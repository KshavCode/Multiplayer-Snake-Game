# Two Player Snake Game 🐍🎮
A simple game which is built in Python. The soundtracks are all created by me and of course the code is also written by me. You just need to download the whole repository and make sure your download the required packages which will be used to run the game. 

You can edit it in your own style too, like changing the background music with any track you like or change the whole theme, redesign the main menu and game over screen.

## Required Package(s) 💻
Pygame, OS & Random

## Controls 🕹
WASD Keys - Player 1 

Arrow Keys - Player 2

## Future Plans 🪐
Currently, it's not guaranteed if the project will be continued or not but if it's continued, then the snake's head would be replaced with a pixel image.

The whole map (play area) will be reorganized into grid format to improve the snake movement accuracy and for accurate food spawning.
